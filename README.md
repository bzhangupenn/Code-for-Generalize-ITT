# generalize ITT

Code to reproduce simulation results, figures, and real data analysis results from the paper "Generalizing the intention-to-treat effect of an active control from historical placebo-controlled trials: A case study of the efficacy of daily oral TDF/FTC in the HPTN 084 study"

## Organization

### simulation_code  

simulation_Scenario_X1.R produces the results for Scenario X1

simulation_Scenario_X2.R produces the results for Scenario X2  

### simulation_results  

The csv files include the results from Scenario X1 and Scenario X2 (with outcome Scenario Y1 and Y2) in the simulation_code folder.

figure.R produces the figures and percentage bias/95% CI in simulation study.

### case study

application.R provides the code to reproduce results for case study. But the real data cannot be shared here.
figure.R produces the figures in the case study.
